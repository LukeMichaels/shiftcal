# This is an AJAX request.  It is passed a "dates" string, which it decodes.
# It can also be passed the id of an existing event, in which case it'll merge
# any information about currently booked dates with the new "dates" list.
# It returns an XML document describing all affected dates.  Parameters are:
#
# dates=	The "dates" string to parse.
#
# id=		Optional.  The id of an existing event, whose current days
#		will be merged into the "dates" list.
#
# reload=	Optional.  If "true" then any dates that match dates= but
#		aren't already booked for id= will be marked as "Deleted"
#		instead of "Added".  calform.php will pass reload=true when
#		you start editing an existing event, but not when change the
#		"dates" input field.
